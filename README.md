# What is this repository?
This repository is used for the programming challenges found in the textbook C++ - From Control Structures Through Objects 8th Edition; written by Tony Gaddis

# How is this repository structured?

This repository will be structured by folders holding each named chapter's programming challenges. (i.e. *Chapter 5 -> Problem_1.cpp*)

I will also be including the questions asked as apart of the README for each chapter.
